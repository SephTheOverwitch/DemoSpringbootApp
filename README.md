# Getting Started

### How to run

1. Position yourself into the root directory of the project
2. Run ```./personia.sh```
   1. If permission to execute is denied run ```sudo chmod +x personia.sh```
3. Access the API on ```localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html```
   1. Username and password are provided in the .env file

### Notes
I havent implemented many tests, just one of each to showcase how I would have done it for the sake 
of saving time.
